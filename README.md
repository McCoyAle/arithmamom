# Arithmamom Math Application
The Arithmamom Math application is a simple golang applications, tied to a postgres database backend which I started to help my daughter practice her math skills in a fun and digital way. This is the first iteration and a UI has not been developed as of yet. If there are any questions or you would like to contribute as a fun way to develop your own skill set then please do fork or clone this repository and get started.
