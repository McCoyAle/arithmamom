# Building and Dockerizing Go Applications 
The goal of this article is to outline the process of building a golang application, containerizing it with Docker and then deploying it to a Kubernetes based cluster. As many discussions as I have had with others regarding the process, I decided it best to outline what that looks like. In addition, I hope to shed some light on some of the different open sourced and cloud native solutions that integrate with it. 

## Introduction

### Who?
Kubernetes, Docker, Golang. 
Kubernetes, Docker, & Golang. 
Kubernetes, Docker, and Golang. 

### What?
Developing a golang application that is containerized utilizing Docker solution and deployed onto infrastructure with Kubernetes as the container orchestration solution. 

### Why?
Container orchestrators provide a reliable way to manage applications without as much human intervention. 

### How?

Will need to create a diagram that depicts the process for:

- Golang Development (option) (not sure how to depict this)
- Containerization process specific to Docker
- Deployment process through Kubernetes deployment, depicting how the components interact with one another.

# Briefly introduce the importance of building and dockerizing Go applications.
# Highlight benefits like portability, reproducibility, and ease of deployment.

## Setting Up a Basic Go Project:

- Walk through the process of setting up a basic Go project.
- Discuss the structure of a typical Go project.

## Building Go Applications:

- Explain the basics of building Go applications using the go build command.
- Discuss the importance of managing dependencies with tools like go mod.

## Introduction to Docker:

- Provide an overview of Docker and containerization.
- Explain the advantages of using Docker for Go applications.

## Creating a Dockerfile:

- Guide readers through the steps of creating a Dockerfile for a Go application.
- Discuss considerations such as base images, environment variables, and dependencies.

## Building Docker Images:

- Explain how to use the docker build command to create Docker images.
- Highlight best practices for optimizing Docker builds.

## Running Docker Containers:

- Demonstrate how to use the docker run command to run containers based on your images.
- Discuss port mapping, volume mounting, and other container-related concepts.

## Multi-Stage Builds (Optional):

- Introduce the concept of multi-stage builds for optimizing Docker images.

Multi-Stage builds was introducted in Docker 17.05, which adds optimization capabilities to make your docker file more consumable or readable. You can read more about the functionality [here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/). Multi-stage builds are enabled by allowing developers to incorporate two "FROM" statements in the Dockerfile. 

What this process does is allow the developer to build an image and complete tasks with required artifacts or tooling, and then build a new image with only the things required from the base image. Therefore, if there are any tools that you needed to complete one task, you do not need to consume resources or space by deploying them with the final image. This is especially beneficial when debugging or when implementing test to test certain features of your code. See the following examples below. 

- Discuss scenarios where multi-stage builds are beneficial.

## Integration with Databases (Optional):

- If applicable, discuss how to integrate Go applications with databases in a Dockerized environment.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices:

- Provide tips for troubleshooting common issues during the build and run phases.
- Discuss best practices for efficient Dockerfile and image management.

## Conclusion

If you are just starting your coding or containerization journey, then this process should at least help you get to a starting point. Any solutions mentioned in this article are based off of my experience and where the last few years have been focused. It does not mean the associated programming language, container runtime, or database will be ideal for your use case. My motto is the best thing to learn is the one that gets the job done. 

When learning new concepts, learn whatever you have access to or what is being utilized within your current team or organization. Remember, software and technology is supposed to be fun and enjoyable, no matter how many bugs you run into. Learn what interests you and continue to "multi-stage" build upon it.
